# Muon Detection Experiment

This repository contains resources and documentation for a physics experiment aimed at detecting cosmic muons and measuring their lifetime using scintillators and Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs).

## üïí Muon Lifetime

Muons are elementary particles similar to electrons but with greater mass. They are produced in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays and decay into electrons and neutrinos. Measuring the lifetime of muons allows physicists to study weak interactions and relativistic effects.

- Typical lifetime: ~2.2 microseconds at rest
- Due to time dilation, muons traveling near the speed of light can reach the Earth's surface

## üí° Scintillators

Scintillators are materials that emit light (photons) when they are excited by ionizing radiation, such as when a muon passes through them. These materials are essential in detecting the passage of muons in our setup.

- Common materials: plastic or inorganic crystals (e.g., NaI(Tl))
- Emit photons in response to charged particles
- Coupled to light sensors (e.g., SiPMs) for readout

## üì∑ Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM)

SiPMs are highly sensitive light detectors used to detect the small flashes of light produced by scintillators. They are compact, solid-state devices with excellent timing resolution.

- Operate in Geiger mode to detect single photons
- Used for timing and energy measurements
- Ideal for portable or compact detector systems
