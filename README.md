# Muon Lifetime Measurement Laboratory

## Abstract
This laboratory aims to estimate the mean lifetime of the muon (œÑŒº) via its dominant decay channel:

**Œº‚Åª ‚Üí e‚Åª + ŒΩÃÖ‚Çë + ŒΩŒº**

The experimental setup uses plastic scintillators, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), and NIM/VME electronics to detect cosmic muons and measure their decay times.

---

## Objectives
- Measure the muon lifetime (œÑŒº) using cosmic ray muons.
- Validate the exponential decay law and relativistic time dilation.
- Compare experimental results with the PDG reference value.

---

## Experimental Setup
- **Scintillators**: 12 plastic scintillators arranged in 3 planes (A, B, C).
- **Iron Absorber**: Stops incoming muons between B and C planes.
- **Detectors**: PMTs coupled to scintillators.
- **Electronics**: NIM & VME crates, logic units, discriminators, dual timers, delay modules.
- **DAQ**: Flash ADC (CAEN v1720), CAENScope software, data analyzed with ROOT.

## Procedure Summary

### 1. Scintillator Efficiency
- Triple coincidence method used to estimate B1 efficiency:

** ŒµB = NABC / NAC**
- Measurements performed across 25 voltage settings.
- Fitted with an error function (Gaussian approximation).
- Optimal voltage range for B1: **1500V‚Äì1800V**, with ŒµB ‚âà 0.8.

### 2. Coincidence Logic & Trigger
- **START**: A ‚à© B ‚à© ¬¨C ‚Äî muon enters and stops in the iron.
- **STOP1**: A ‚à© B ‚à© G ‚Äî decay particle exits upward.
- **STOP2**: C ‚à© G ‚Äî decay particle exits downward.
- **Trigger**: OR(STOP1, STOP2), with backward readout enabled.
- **Gate Width**: 10 ¬µs, delayed by 85.5 ns to prevent false triggers.

### 3. Data Acquisition
- Flash ADC samples at 250 MSa/s (4 ns resolution), 12-bit precision.
- Signals converted to digital and stored (8192 samples per event).
- Analysis identifies START/STOP signals and computes time differences.

### 4. Data Analysis
- Events analyzed using ROOT framework.
- Lifetime calculated as time between START and STOP signals.
- Histogram fitted with:
** N(t) = p‚ÇÄ ¬∑ exp(‚àít/p‚ÇÅ) + p‚ÇÇ**

- Extracted lifetime:
**  œÑŒº = 2113 ¬± 58 (stat) ¬± 26 (syst) ns**

## Conclusion
- The measured value is consistent with the PDG reference value (~2197 ns).
- STOP1 gives more reliable results due to dual-plane coincidence.
- STOP2 affected by background noise and geometric uncertainty.
- Confirms the expected exponential decay law and relativistic effects in cosmic muons.

## üí° Scintillators

Scintillators are materials that emit light (photons) when they are excited by ionizing radiation, such as when a muon passes through them. These materials are essential in detecting the passage of muons in our setup.




- Common materials: plastic or inorganic crystals (e.g., NaI(Tl))
- Emit photons in response to charged particles
- Coupled to light sensors (e.g., SiPMs) for readout

## üì∑ Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM)

SiPMs are highly sensitive light detectors used to detect the small flashes of light produced by scintillators. They are compact, solid-state devices with excellent timing resolution.


- Operate in Geiger mode to detect single photons
- Used for timing and energy measurements
- Ideal for portable or compact detector systems
